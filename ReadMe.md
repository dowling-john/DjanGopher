*This Project is still experimental*
-------

The DjanGopher project is an alternative to the Django framework for Go developers. I decided to create the project to
expand the wonderful work that the Django developers have done over the years and bring some of the built-in benefits of the 
Go programming language.

These built-in features like static typing and concurrency can help us when building better and more robust web applications.

I would love help in building this software so if you have time and willing please get in contact.


Philosophy of the project 
-----
    - Minimal use of external libraries
        - External libraries bring increased security risks, minimising this risk is one of the top priorities.

    - Ease of Use
        - Code readabillity over fancy functionality


Initial MVP Objectives
-----
    - Async Handlers using go-routines
    - Build Models 
    - Accept http requests 
    - Build http responses
    - Create base Project using a commandline tools
    - Templating - look @ a component based achitecture 

Tools

    - Migrations tooling the same as Django <- Go install 
    - Creating Projects
